# This is fairly easy to do and can be done for string values with whitespace between:

def name_inverter(str_): # Function to resort the names
    return ' '.join(reversed(str_.split(' ')))
    
# With a comma seperation:

def name_inverter(str_): # Function to resort the names
    return ', '.join(reversed(str_.split(' ')))
    
# or you can easily reverse a list using the .reverse() method. Everything in Python is geared towards manipulation of larger structures which is why
# list manipulation is much easier

def list_reverser(L):
    return L.reverse()
    
list = [1,2,3]
list_reverser(list)

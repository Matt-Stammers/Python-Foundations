'''
Create a function close_compare that compares two numbers a and b.
When a is lower than b, return -1.
When a is higher than b, return 1.
However when a and b are the same or close within margin, return 0. Margin may not always be given.
Example: if a = 3, b = 5 and the margin is 3, since a and b are no more than 3 apart, close_compare should return 0. Otherwise, if margin is 0, a is less than b and close_compare should return -1.
Assume: margin >= 0
'''

def close_compare(a, b, margin=0):
  diff = a - b
  if abs(diff) <= margin:
    return 0
  elif a > b:
    return 1
  else:
    return -1
    
# this can be simplified to:

def close_compare(a, b, margin = 0):
    return 0 if abs(a - b) <= margin else -1 if b > a else 1

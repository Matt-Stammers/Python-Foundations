# This one is also tricky in Python - once again conversion to a string will work to manipulate a number

def no_boring_zeros(n):
    try:
        result = int(str(n).rstrip("0"))
        return result
    except:
        return 0

#Another way to achieve this, say for a phone number to strip out the zero's is:

In [11]: s = '07123456789'

In [12]: '44{}'.format(s[1:] if s.startswith('0') else s)
Out[12]: '447123456789'
